# birthdayproblem

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of birthdayproblem is to be used
as a demonstration of writing a simple R package.
It can be used to calculate 
(or approximate by simulation) probabilities
of people in a group sharing the same birthday.


## Installation

You can install birthdayproblem from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("heogden/birthdayproblem")
```
## Example

Suppose that there are 30 people in a room. What is the chance that at least two of them share the same birthday?

```{r example}
library(birthdayproblem)
birthday_match_prob(30)
```
